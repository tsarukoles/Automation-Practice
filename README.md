#Automation Practice - Orange HRM End-to-End Tests

    This project is an automation testing framework for the Orange HRM application, using Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing. The tests are written to verify the functionality of the Orange HRM web application, including user login, recruitment processes, and other key features.

    - tests/: Contains all the test cases written for Orange HRM.
    - pages/: Implements the Page Object Model (POM), which abstracts the locators and actions for different pages in the Orange HRM application.
    - fixtures/: Stores test data like user credentials and test parameters in JSON format.
    - playwright-report/: Contains reports generated after test executions.
    - .github/workflows/: Contains the CI configuration for running tests automatically via GitHub Actions.

Getting Started

    Prerequisites

To run the tests locally, ensure that you have the following installed:

    Node.js (version 18 or higher)
    npm (Node package manager)

Setup

    1) Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automation-Practice.git
    cd Automation-Practice/orange_hrm

    2) Install the required dependencies:
    
    npm install
    
    3) Install Playwright browsers:
    
    npx playwright install --with-deps

Running Tests

    To run the Playwright tests, use the following commands:

    Run all tests:
    
    npx playwright test
    
    Run tests for a specific file:
    
    npx playwright test tests/login.spec.js
    
    Run tests in headed mode (with visible browser):
    
    npx playwright test --headed
    
    Run tests in specific browsers:
    
    npx playwright test --project=chromium  # For Chromium
    npx playwright test --project=firefox   # For Firefox
    npx playwright test --project=webkit    # For WebKit

    Running Tests in CI (GitHub Actions)
    
    The project is configured to automatically run Playwright tests via GitHub Actions on each push or pull request to the main branch. You can monitor the test runs under the Actions tab of the repository.
    
    Testing with JSON Data
    
    Test data such as credentials are stored in JSON format in the fixtures directory. The test files reference these data fixtures to keep the tests dynamic and reusable.
    
    Example of using test data:
    
    const userData = require('../fixtures/userData.json');
    await loginPage.login(userData.adminBaseUser.username, userData.adminBaseUser.password);

Playwright Reports

    After running the tests, a detailed HTML report is generated. To view the report locally:
    
    npx playwright show-report
    
    The report will be available at http://localhost:9323/, and it provides a breakdown of the test results, including any failures with screenshots and videos (if configured).
    
    In CI, if tests fail, the Playwright report is uploaded as an artifact, allowing you to download and inspect it.

GitHub Actions CI Setup

    The Playwright tests are automatically run in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/playwright.yml. This configuration runs the tests in headless mode on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
    
    Key CI Commands:
    
    Install Dependencies: Installs project dependencies.
    Run Playwright Tests: Executes all tests in headless mode.
    Upload Reports: In case of failure, Playwright reports are uploaded as artifacts for inspection.
    
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: '18'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
            working-directory: orange_hrm
          - name: Run Playwright tests
            run: npx playwright test
            working-directory: orange_hrm
          - name: Upload Playwright report
            if: failure()
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: playwright-report
              path: orange_hrm/playwright-report/
